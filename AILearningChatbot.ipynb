TheM =9 polynomial is therefore capa-\\nble of generating results at least as good as theM =3 polynomial. Furthermore, we\\nmight suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the functionsin(2πx)\\nfrom which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the\\ncase). We know that a power series expansion of the function sin(2πx) contains\\nterms of all orders, so we might expect that results should improve monotonically as\\nwe increase M.\\nWe can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the co-\\nefﬁcients w⋆ obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1.\\nWe see that, asM increases, the magnitude of the coefﬁcients typically gets larger.\\nIn particular for theM =9 polynomial, the coefﬁcients have become ﬁnely tuned\\nto the data by developing large positive and negative values so that the correspond-\\nTable 1.1 Table of the coefﬁcients w⋆ for\\npolynomials of various order.\\nObserve how the typical mag-\\nnitude of the coefﬁcients in-\\ncreases dramatically as the or-\\nder of the polynomial increases.\\nM =0 M =1 M =6 M =9\\nw⋆\\n0 0.19 0.82 0.31 0.35\\nw⋆\\n1 -1.27 7.99 232.37\\nw⋆\\n2 -25.43 -5321.83\\nw⋆\\n3 17.37 48568.31\\nw⋆\\n4 -231639.30\\nw⋆\\n5 640042.26\\nw⋆\\n6 -1061800.52\\nw⋆\\n7 1042400.18\\nw⋆\\n8 -557682.99\\nw⋆\\n9 125201.43')"
